# Reddit-User-Comment-Scraper
 Scraps from a couple of usernames according to subreddit and publishes it in a reddit post  
  
 In this case it takes blizz usernames from their respective subreddits, but it can be applied to other things if one wishes to get certain groups of users comments from a subreddit.
